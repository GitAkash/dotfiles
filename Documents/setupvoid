Setup battery (No unnecesarry charging) on Thinkpad:
- install xi acpi_call-dkm
- install tpacpi-bat

Not sure anymore what this does:
- /etc/elogind/logind.conf -> suspend setup

For making sudo useable on colemak: (DID THIS REALLY DO SOMETHING?)
 su
 echo 'Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET"' >> /etc/sudoers

 Upgrade firmware using fwupd, read about it @aw when really needed. I update my thinkpad with it.
